# NBA_Endorser


Background:

As a new brand in the sports apparel market, we are looking for potential endorsers in NBA. Due to our tight budget, we want a player who can estabilish a long term relationship at relatively low cost rahter than sign a contract with players who already have endorsements.



Description of Data:

There are two datasets we use primarily for this project. The first one is NBA 2017 endorsement stats. It is a dataset that contains top 10 NBA edorsers in 2017. It has endorsement values, which is how much each player on the dataset has earned from endorsment. It also has players wikipedia pageviews and twitter favorite counts that can be used as measurements for players social power. The other dataset is NBA players' performance dataset of 2017. This dataset is mainly use as a tool to anlysis top NBA edorsers from performance perspective. It has importants performance measurements such as points per game, minutes played per game, how many games each NBA player has played etc. In the future steps, it can further help us find potential edorsers for out brand.
